<h2><b>SwiftEdDSA</b></h2>

SwiftEdDSA implements the EdDSA digital signature algorithm as defined in RFC 8032.
It is based on the Edwards 25519 and Edwards 448 elliptic curves.

SwiftEdDSA functionality:
<ul>
<li>Create public and private keys</li>
<li>Sign messages - deterministically or non-deterministically</li>
<li>Verify signatures</li>
</ul>
SwiftEdDSA requires Swift 5.0. It also requires that the Int and UInt types be 64 bit types.

Its documentation is build with Apple's DocC tool and published on GitHub Pages at this location

The documentation is also available in the <i>SwiftEdDSA.doccarchive</i> file.
